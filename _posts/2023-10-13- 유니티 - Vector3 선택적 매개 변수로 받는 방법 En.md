Actually, it seems like it can be used for more than just Vector! It seems like things like RaycastHit can also be used... Or not... Aside from!

``` c#
public void Function(Vector3? position = null)
```

OR

``` c#
public void Function(Vector3 position = default(Vector3))
```

Now, you can use these for optional arguments. However, when using 'Vector3?', you need to make the value definite.

It seems like it can be applied to other Values as well, not just vectors. MAYBE...hehe

``` c#
Debug.Log(default(Vector3)) 
```

I tried it, and it outputs (0.00, 0.00, 0.00).

Well... unless that value is provided as an argument, you can handle exceptions if the value is not input like this:

```c#
if(position != default(Vector3)){
    //코드 넣기
}
```

um... hope i helped.
